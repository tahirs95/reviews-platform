            <span class="text-center about-description">
                The concept for Vimbiso came to me in November 2020, it was triggered by a moment of reflection.
                There is an undeniably negative perception of Zimbabwean owned businesses, public institutions, parastatals, NGO’s & civil society organisation.
                I have continually heard words & phrases such as, poor quality, corruption, lack lustre service delivery, theft, deception, dishonesty just to name a few.
                Granted some of these views are accurate there are some dubious entities in the Zimbabwean community however there are also some fantastically impressive entities which consequently through no fault of their own are painted with the same brush.
                With this in mind I thought to myself there must be a way for consumers, donors and investors to filter between the dubious entities & the genuine ones.
                I concluded the best way of doing this was social proof which by definition comes from customers & stake holders, and with declining trust those voices tend to carry a lot more weight than a branded message from the entities themselves.
                In a nutshell Vimbiso is a platform to showcase & promote those genuine entities Zimbabwe has to offer the Zimbabwean community & beyond.
                Vimbiso will through social proof allow entities to take advantage of external validation and consumer advocacy in order to improve & in still confidence to consumers, donors & investors on a global stage.
